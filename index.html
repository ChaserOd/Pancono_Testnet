<h2>🚀Option 1: Invite Friends & Mining.</h2>
 
<h2>Download Wallet for Mining</h2>
<p>Click above<strong> 'Download Core Wallet'</strong> at next page find the <strong>'Pancono.Core.Wallet.zip & Core.wallet'</strong> at the bottom. Download both the zip files, extract it and start mining by double clicking the <strong>application</strong> file. User can choose whether to mine points or coins accordingly. Read instruction on how to mine at the application.</p>
<br />
<p><strong> Mine per block in every 1 to 2 min.</strong> Can mine on Laptop/Desktop (CPU/GPU) with low mining dificulty.</p> Get your Invite friend link from Telegram Bot and invite 3 firends to quailfy for the Mainnet migration of your mined coins or points, straight into your Mainnet core wallet.

  
 <h2>Start Mining</h2> 

<p> Users can mine multiple blocks every day — for each successful block mined on the blockchain, users will earn <strong>30 PANNO</strong>. Check the image and video below on how to mine. Can also explore additional features like sending coins, importing pancono's wallets private keys, sharing core wallet with friends, and encouraging them to use the wallet.</p>

<p>Keep both the downloaded folder secure. At a later stage, we may request you to submit the folders for verification. The verification process will take place during mainnet launch.</p>


<br />
  
<h2>Peer to Peer Connection </h2>
<p>
  Important Note: Peer-to-peer connection are currently disabled during mining phase at downloaded core wallets. The peers feature has been intentionally paused, users cannot send or receive PANNO to other users, but they can transfer coins between their own wallet addresses for testing purposes. P2P transfers will be fully enabled in the Mainnet version of the Core Wallet.

  <h1> What is different between Pancono coins and Points? </h1> 

<p> When you mine <strong>Pancono coins</strong>, you are directly participating in the <strong>Pancono airdrop</strong>, and all rewards will be credited in <strong>Pancono coins (PANNO)</strong>. When you mine <strong>Points</strong>, it means you are mining <strong>other newly launched coins of partner's projects</strong> that will be added to the Pancono ecosystem during the Mainnet launch. </p> 
  <p> The conversion of points into coins those projects— and receiving those coins in your wallet — will depend on multiple factors, such as: <br>• The block height at which the points were mined <br>• Total number of blocks mined <br>• Which partner projects the users joined during the mining phase </p> <p> In simple terms: <strong>every user will earn both Pancono coins and additional partner coins</strong>, all of which will be distributed during the **Pancono Mainnet launch** as part of the blockchain ecosystem rewards. </p>

  <h1>Tockennomics & Migration</h1>
<p><strong>The Mainnet ecosystem will launch soon after the mining phase is completed. All PANNO coins and points earned by you will be available for conversion (of points to coins) and migration to your Mainnet non-custodial Pancono core wallet during the airdrop allocation and launch period.</strong></p>
<p>Details regarding migration, Mainnet launch, airdrop distribution, final tokenomics, and all future announcements will be shared here across our official communication platforms(X, Telegram).</p>
